			<h2> Introduction of Myself </h2>
			<img src="image23.jpg" style="width:230px" height="200px">
			
			<p> Greetings! <br> I am Bea Bianca Razo Diago an aspiring programmer from Nasugbu, Batangas.
			This student of Cavite State University Main Campus, <br> taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
			was a 19-year old dreamer. Being a programmer was not on my choice before <br> because I love cooking, it was
			my passion that's why I took Home Economics before. The Second option was photography,<br> I will always love 
			this one because it enhance my skills in this field. But after I watched a movie <br> entitled "Mission Impossible,"
			it caughts my attention, and by the help of the editing of the director of the movie <br>and the flow of the story
			I already want to study the programming. Other than that, I also had a research about the top jobs that <br>a person 
			should take was being a Software Engineer or a Developer.</p>
			
			<p> To elaborate myself, I really don't have any idea about the programming that's why it is so hard for me to <br>
			cope up easilly on our major subjects. I am hoping that I will gain enough knowledge and learn well because being <br>
			at the track that I've never been before. It was happy being in a simple life in the province,<br> waking up in 
			the morning to see the sunrise, been there during sunset since we lived near the sea. But,<br>Infomartion Techonology
			teach me that as person, I should go beyond the boundaries of what I can do, so I decided to grab the chance<br>
			to become one of the web and software developers that can help community in any means that I can do.<br> I opened the
			door of opportunity to do things that I never expected that I can do.
			</p>
